# IAM as a Critical Security Risk in Cloud Environments

From a security standpoint, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is one
of the most critical components in cloud infrastructure.

Cloud environments operate in a multi-tenant model, meaning that a failure
in access control does not impact a single user, but potentially multiple
customers and services.

If the self-service model is poorly implemented, users may obtain excessive
permissions, leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to
sensitive information such as personal data, credentials or financial records.

In cloud architecture, identity becomes the new security perimeter.
Once valid permissions are granted, traditional network controls provide
limited protection.

For this reason, principles such as Least Privilege, Role-Based Access
Control (RBAC), and continuous auditing are essential to prevent systemic
security failures.
